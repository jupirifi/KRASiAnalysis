# KrasI Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for performing a pipeline of single-cell analysis. The general purpose of these notebooks is to integrate/batch correct the data, followed by cNMF of the cellxgenes matrices and downstream biological analysis of the data. 

## Notebooks Overview

1.  **`run_scvi.ipynb`**: A general-purpose implementation of the pipeline on the KrasI dataset. 
2.  **`run_scvi_KPTracer_KRASi.ipynb`**: A specialized notebook focused on the integration of the previous KP-Tracer data with the new KrasI dataset.
